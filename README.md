# SUMS-Data

### Purpose

This project is supposed to be used to read CSVs and create plots of the data in them. The CSVs are specifically formatted to include certain information that is utilized by the script.

### TODO

- [ ] Add comments to understand what's going on
- [ ] Generate a report (i.e. output a text file) based on the given data
  - Average attendance across all events
  - Event with greatest attendance + time and date it was held
  - Event with least attendance + time and date it was held

### Notes

* It uses `pandas` and `matplotlib` to read the CSV data and create plots, respectively. 
* This was my first time using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to parse information like this. Not pretty, not efficient, but does what it's supposed to
* Structurally, I was unsure of what to do. It needs improvement for sure. This project was also my way of utilizing Python in ways I hadn't before, so definitely a learning opportunity.
