# Tracking attendance for org. events

## What this is

This project was made specifically for tracking the attendance at my student org.'s events. It utilizes the Pandas and Matplotlib modules for Python to create a graph based on a very specifically formatted CSV. 

## Why I care about this project at all

This project is by no means finished, nor is it a work of art. It was my first time using Pandas and Matplotlib, and I wanted to use their capabilities together to create something practical. Additionally, I used it to freshen up my Python skills as, prior to its creation, I hadn't written much in Python. Finally, this project was my first introduction to using Git for version control. I wasn't the most skilled in it, but we're always improving.
