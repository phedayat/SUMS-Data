# SUMS-Data

### Purpose

This project is supposed to be used to read CSVs and create plots of the data in them. The CSVs are specifically formatted to include certain information that is utilized by the script.

### Notes

* It uses `pandas` and `matplotlib` to read the CSV data and create plots, respectively. 
* This was my first time using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to parse information like this. Not pretty, not efficient, but does what it's supposed to
* Structurally, I was unsure of what to do. It needs improvement for sure. This project was also my way of utilizing Python in ways I hadn't before, so definitely a learning opportunity.
